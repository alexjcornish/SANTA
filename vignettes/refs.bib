@article{Aerts2006,
	Abstract = {The identification of genes involved in health and disease remains
	a challenge. We describe a bioinformatics approach, together with
	a freely accessible, interactive and flexible software termed Endeavour,
	to prioritize candidate genes underlying biological processes or
	diseases, based on their similarity to known genes involved in these
	phenomena. Unlike previous approaches, ours generates distinct prioritizations
	for multiple heterogeneous data sources, which are then integrated,
	or fused, into a global ranking using order statistics. In addition,
	it offers the flexibility of including additional data sources. Validation
	of our approach revealed it was able to efficiently prioritize 627
	genes in disease data sets and 76 genes in biological pathway sets,
	identify candidates of 16 mono- or polygenic diseases, and discover
	regulatory genes of myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, the approach
	identified a novel gene involved in craniofacial development from
	a 2-Mb chromosomal region, deleted in some patients with DiGeorge-like
	birth defects. The approach described here offers an alternative
	integrative method for gene discovery.},

@article{Bandyopadhyay2010,
	Abstract = {Although cellular behaviors are dynamic, the networks that govern
	these behaviors have been mapped primarily as static snapshots. Using
	an approach called differential epistasis mapping, we have discovered
	widespread changes in genetic interaction among yeast kinases, phosphatases,
	and transcription factors as the cell responds to DNA damage. Differential
	interactions uncover many gene functions that go undetected in static
	conditions. They are very effective at identifying DNA repair pathways,
	highlighting new damage-dependent roles for the Slt2 kinase, Pph3
	phosphatase, and histone variant Htz1. The data also reveal that
	protein complexes are generally stable in response to perturbation,
	but the functional relations between these complexes are substantially
	reorganized. Differential networks chart a new type of genetic landscape
	that is invaluable for mapping cellular responses to stimuli.},
